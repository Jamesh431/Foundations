for i in range(1, 11):
    if i > 1 or i < 8:
        print(i)

        # used or because the numbers need to be both more than 1 and less than 8, meaning 2 3 4 5 6 7

# In a range between 1 and 10, print out just the numbers 2-7. Your code should loop through the range 1, 10, but the output should be:
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
