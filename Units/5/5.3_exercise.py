# a = 6
# b = 5.5
# c = a * b
# print(int(c))
# Data loss because it results in 33 when as a float it would equal 33.0

# s = "John"
# k = "95"
# print(s + k)
# works just fine

# g = 3.14159265
# print(int(g))
# data loss as all decimal numbers were lost when converted to an int

# c = "Done"
# d = 100
# j = c + d
# print(j)
# resulted in an error due to there being no quotations

# r = 4.345
# d = 99.1
# print(float(r) + float(d))
# works fine
