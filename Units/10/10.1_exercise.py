def multiply_two_numbers(num_one, num_two):
    total = num_one * num_two
    print(f'{num_one} times {num_two} is {total}')
    return total

  # return total isn't even needed for this type of function. It does the exact same without it
multiply_two_numbers(4, 3)

# Here are two variables. Write a function that multiplies their values into one variable called "total", and logs it to the console. Extra credit if you include a string like "8 times 2 is 16". An example run of the program where we have passed 4 and 3 might be: "4 times 3 is 12"
